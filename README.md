Haskell for impatient poker players
===================================

This tutorial is intended to be viewed in
[FP Haskell Center](https://www.fpcomplete.com/ide?git=git@github.com:snoyberg/haskell-impatient-poker-players.git).
It provides a step-by-step means of building up some Haskell code based around everyone's favorite card game, poker.

I call this an *impatient* tutorial since, as much as possible, we try to jump into working code, and avoid
going into details of what the code is doing unless necessary. This is a good way to get a taste for programming
in Haskell, but if you want to properly learn the language, I'd recommend
[reading a real tutorial](https://www.fpcomplete.com/school/starting-with-haskell/introduction-to-haskell/1-haskell-basics).

You should be able to follow this tutorial without any experience with programming in general, or Haskell in particular.
However, since I won't be focusing on details, it should be equally usable by an experienced programmer trying to get
a feel for Haskell.

To get started, please click on "Lesson01" in the module list on the left. Each module is a combination of code
and comments which explain that code. Each module is fully editable. As you're reading through, feel free to
modify the code as much as you want to explore new ideas.
